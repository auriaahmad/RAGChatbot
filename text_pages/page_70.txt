Automated Palletizer System Project
Introduction:
Our company provides comprehensive industrial automation services, including PLC Programming, HMI design, SCADA Systems, and process automation. With over 8 years of experience, we have executed several successful projects, and one of them is the Automated Palletizer System.
Project Background:
A manufacturing company faced the challenge of manually arranging packets of products coming from a packing machine into pallets, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive. To automate this process, they approached our company to design and implement a solution.
Problem Statement:
A horizontal conveyor driven by a motor takes packets from the outlet of a packing machine to a palletizer. The packets are arranged in a sequence of four packets in one row. The company was tasked with automating the process to improve efficiency and reduce manual labor.
The requirements for the automated system were:
Initially, the system should be in standby mode
There should be two modes of operation: auto mode and manual/setting mode
There should be a user login system for controlling the system. Operators should only have access to the auto mode while technicians should have full access.
In auto mode, pressing the start button should turn on the motor and run the conveyor, causing the packets to move towards the pallet.
A cylinder should extend to stop the movement of the packets towards the pallet when 4 packets have passed, as detected by a sensor.
Limit switches should indicate the extended or retracted position of the cylinder.
After 5 seconds of the extension of the first cylinder, the motor should stop, and a second cylinder should extend to push the 4 packets onto the pallet.
When this cylinder is retracted, the cycle should start again.
There should be a reset button to reset the system to its initial condition.
If the stop button is pressed, the system should go into a fault condition and must be reset to start again.
If the packet is not detected for some time, the system should go into standby mode, and an error of a missing sensor should be displayed, which can be reset by the reset button.
In manual mode, each output should be controlled manually with buttons.
The company used the following equipment to execute the project:
Solution Provided:
Our team of experts designed and implemented a complete solution to meet the customer’s requirements. The following is a step-by-step description of the solution.
Logic and HMI Design:
The logic and HMI layout were designed using the TIA Portal software.
Inputs and Outputs:
All the inputs and outputs were connected, including limit switches to indicate the extended or retracted position of the cylinder, an object sensor to detect the packets, buttons, and LED indicators.
Siemens PLC and HMI:
A Siemens PLC and HMI were used to control the conveyor and manage the automation process.
Pneumatic Cylinders:
Two pneumatic cylinders were used to stop and push the packets on the pallet.
Standby Mode: The system was set to be in standby mode initially.
Auto Mode:
In auto mode, the conveyor would start when the start button was pressed, and the packets would move towards the pallet. The first cylinder would extend to stop the movement of packets when four packets had passed, as detected by the sensor.
Manual Mode:
In manual mode, each output could be controlled manually using buttons.
User Login:
There was a user login system, with operator access to auto mode only and technician access to both auto and manual modes.
Error Handling:
The system was designed to go into a fault condition if the stop button was pressed and had to be reset to start again. If the packet was not detected for some time, the system would go into standby mode, and an error of missing sensor would display, which could be reset using the reset button.
Cycle:
After five seconds of the extension of the first cylinder, the motor would stop, and a second cylinder would extend to push the four packets onto the pallet. When the cylinder was retracted, the cycle would start again.
Testing:
Our team conducted thorough simulation tests and verified the functionality of the logic successfully.
Outcome:
The Automated Palletizer System was a complete success, providing the manufacturing company with a fully automated solution that improved efficiency and reduced labor costs. The system was easy to use and provided reliable and accurate performance, and the customer was extremely satisfied with the results.
Conclusion:
Our team was able to provide the client with a solution that met their requirements, resulting in increased efficiency and accuracy while reducing manual labor. The automated palletizer system was a success, and the client was extremely satisfied with the outcome. This project has been added to our portfolio as a demonstration of our expertise in industrial automation services.
