Stepper Motor Control using Domore PLC Project
Project Overview:
Our company provided services related to industrial automation. It was approached by a client who needed assistance in controlling a stepper motor to move an object to and fro. The client was required to rotate the stepper motor in a clockwise direction. When the start button was pressed, move the object 1000 steps forward, and then rotate the motor in a counter-clockwise direction and move the object 1000 steps backward. The object was required to return to the home position when the stop button was pressed.
Our team used a combination of Domore PLC, a stepper motor, a stepper motor drive, and a lead screw to control the stepper motor and move the object. The logic was designed using the Domore software, and the PLC was installed at the site. The inputs and outputs were connected, and the functionality of the system was tested successfully
The project was completed successfully, meeting the client’s requirements. Our team provided training to the client’s operators on the usage of the system, and the system was commissioned and handed over to the client.
This project demonstrated our team’s expertise in industrial automation and our ability to deliver solutions that meet the specific requirements of our clients. The successful completion of this project added another satisfied client to our portfolio and further strengthened our position in the market.
Equipment/Hardware Used
The project was executed using Domore PLC, a stepper motor, a stepper motor drive, and a lead screw.
Solution Provided
Requirements gathering and analysis:
The first step was to understand the client’s requirements and analyze the problem statement. Our team had a detailed discussion with the client to understand the requirement and specifications of the stepper motor control system.
Logic design:
Based on the requirements, our team designed the logic using the Domore software. The logic was designed to control the stepper motor and move the object to and fro
PLC installation:
The next step was to install the PLC at the site. Our team installed the PLC and ensured that it was functioning properly.
Input/Output connections:
The inputs and outputs were connected to the PLC. The inputs included the start and stop buttons, while the outputs were connected to the stepper motor and the limit switch.
Functionality testing:
Once the installation and connections were completed, our team tested the functionality of the system. The testing was carried out to ensure that the stepper motor was rotating in the correct direction and moving the object as required.
Final commissioning:
Upon successful testing, the system was commissioned and handed over to the client. Our team provided training to the client’s operators on the usage of the system.
Conclusion
The project was executed using a combination of Domore PLC, a stepper motor, a stepper motor drive, and a lead screw. Our team successfully designed the logic, installed the PLC, and connected the inputs and outputs. The testing confirmed that the system was functioning as required, and the project was completed successfully, meeting the client’s requirements.
