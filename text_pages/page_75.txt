Automated Fire Detection System Project
Introduction:
Our company, a provider of industrial automation services with over 8 years of experience, was recently commissioned to design a fire detection system for a commercial plaza located in the United Kingdom. The building was a three-story structure that required a comprehensive solution to detect and control fires in the event of an emergency.
Problem Statement:
The problem statement for the Automated Fire Detection System project is to design a fire detection system for a commercial plaza with three floors located in the UK. The system should utilize smoke detectors for fire detection and have specific protocols in place for different floors in case of fire detection. In case of fire on the 1st floor, the Head of the Stair Automatic Opening Vent (AOV), 1st-floor damper, AOV, and sprinkler should open and the fan should start running. In case of fire on the 2nd floor, the stair AOV, 2nd-floor AOV, and sprinkler should open. Similarly, in case of fire on the 3rd floor, the stair AOV, 3rd-floor AOV, and sprinkler should open. The outputs should remain on until manually reset using a reset button. The damper and AOV take 90 seconds to open or close and should not be interrupted during this process. An HMI display should also be designed to show all inputs and outputs and their status.
Design and Implementation:
The logic for the fire detection system was designed using Siemens TIA Portal software. The HMI (Human Machine Interface) layout, which would control access to the system, was designed using Easy builder software. The PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) was installed on-site and all inputs and outputs were connected as required. The equipment used included a Siemens PLC, Weintek HMI, 24V relays, and smoke sensors.
Features of the System:
Fire Detection:
In the event of a fire, smoke detectors would trigger an alarm and activate the appropriate response, depending on the floor where the fire was detected.
Response to Fire:
In the event of a fire on the first floor, the head of the stair AOV (Automatic Opening Vent) would open, along with the first-floor damper, AOV, and sprinkler, and the fan would run. In the event of a fire on the second floor, the stair AOV, second-floor AOV, and sprinkler would open. If the fire was detected on the third floor, the stair AOV, third-floor AOV, and sprinkler would open.
Output Control:
Once activated, any output would remain on until manually reset using a reset button.
Damper and AOV Control:
The damper and AOV would take 90 seconds to open or close, and should not be interrupted during this process.
HMI Display:
The HMI display would show all inputs and outputs and their status. In the event of an input or output being activated, its status would be displayed on the HMI.
Testing and Commissioning:
After the installation of the Automated Fire Detection System, the next step was to test and commission the system to ensure it was functioning as per the design requirements and expectations. The following steps were carried out during testing and commissioning:
Verification of Inputs:
The first step was to verify the functionality of the smoke sensors and ensure that they were sending the right signals to the PLC.
Testing the Outputs:
Once the inputs were verified, the next step was to test the outputs such as the damper, AOV, sprinkler, and fan to confirm that they were opening or closing as per the design requirements.
Check the HMI Display:
The HMI display was checked to ensure that it was showing the right status of inputs and outputs.
Integration Testing:
The system was tested as a whole to ensure that all components were working in sync and as per the design.
Final Testing:
After completing all the required tests, a final test was carried out to verify the functionality of the entire system.
Commissioning:
After successful testing, the system was commissioned and handed over to the client for use.
During the testing and commissioning phase, any issues that were encountered were resolved promptly to ensure the smooth functioning of the system. The system was tested thoroughly to ensure that it met the design requirements and provided reliable fire protection for the commercial plaza.
Conclusion:
The Automated Fire Detection System designed and implemented by our company provides a comprehensive solution for fire detection and control in commercial buildings. With features such as smoke detection, automatic response to fire, output control, damper and AOV control, and a clear and informative HMI display, the system ensures safety and control in the event of a fire. The successful testing and commissioning of the project demonstrate our commitment to providing high-quality industrial automation services to our clients.
